## Overview

We are tasked with finding out how New York's Citibike will work in Des Moines a much smaller city. We are doing this by analyzing trip data from August of 2019. We looked at the number of rides, the number of subscribers, peak hours, trip duration, rides by age and gender, bike utilization and bikes that are due for repair. Reviewing this data should give us a good idea how Citibike will work in Des Moines.

## Results

Using Tableau I created 7 different visualizations using the total number of trips, the types of users, and the trip duration.

- There are almost 4 times more subscribers than regular customers
- Male users make up almost 3 quarter of the Citibike users
- The most popular trip durations are around 5-6 minutes, and none go past an hour
- The trip duration times seems to be consistent with both men and women
- Most of the weekday usage is between 7a-9a and 5p-7p and on the weekends the afternoons between 9a-6p are the most popular rental times
- There doesn't seem to be a significant difference between men and women weekday and weekend usage.
- There are generally more subscribers than regular users however there is a significant difference in men subscribers versus regular men customers

## Summary

We were able to uncover useful data that will not only help Des Moines decide if Citibike will work for them, but for other cities as well. There are two more visualizations I would like to see. The first would be the distance traveled from starting point to end point. I think this will would really help to determine if Des Moines is large enough. Even though the data wasn't provided I would like to see the cost of a Citibike ride compared to average annual salary in Des Moines. The size of the available market could be a important determining factor for any city to consider.
